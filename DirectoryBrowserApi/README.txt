DirectoryBrowserApi

Explore directories on the hosting server
The table shows the count of all files in the current directory and all the subdirectories.

Press on folder names to explore them
Use link "Previous folder" to return to the parent directory,
link "Drives" to chose another driver,
link "Refresh" to update the current folder.

You also can press on a directory name in the "Browse path" to directly jump in a directory.

Counting all files can be a long process, wait some time and it'll be there.
Files in protected folders will not be counted.

Possible errors will be shown on the top.

The API is made to be consumed by the index.htlm page, and it is not recommended sending http requests directly.
